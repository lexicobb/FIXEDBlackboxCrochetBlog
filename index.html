    <h1>Welcome to my Crochet Blog!</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my crochet blog! I'm so excited to share my love for crochet with you all. Here you'll find all sorts of crochet-related content, from patterns and tutorials to tips and tricks for improving your crochet skills.</p>
    <h2>Crochet Pattern of the Week: Granny Square</h2>
    <p>This week's pattern is the classic granny square! Granny squares are a staple in the crochet world and are a great way to use up leftover yarn. They can be made into all sorts of things, from blankets and pillows to bags and scarves.</p>
    <p>To make a granny square, you'll need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Yarn in your choice of color(s)</li>
      <li>A crochet hook in the appropriate size for your yarn</li>
      <li>Scissors</li>
      <li>A yarn needle</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's a simple pattern to get you started:</p>
    <p>Chain 4 and join with a slip stitch to form a ring.</p>
    <p>Round 1: Chain 3 (counts as first double crochet), 2 double crochet in ring, *chain 2, 3 double crochet in ring; repeat from \* 2 more times, chain 2, join with a slip stitch in top of chain 3.</p>
    <p>Round 2: Slip stitch in next 2 double crochet and in next chain-2 space, chain 3 (counts as first double crochet), 2 double crochet in same space, *chain 2, 3 double crochet in next chain-2 space; repeat from \* 2 more times, chain 2, join with a slip stitch in top of chain 3.</p>
    <p>Repeat round 2 until your granny square is the desired size.</p>
    <h2>Crochet Tip of the Week: Blocking</h2>
    <p>Blocking is a technique used to shape and smooth out crochet pieces. It can make a big difference in the final appearance of your project. To block a piece, you'll need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A blocking mat or a towel</li>
      <li>Pins</li>
      <li>A spray bottle filled with water</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's how to block a piece:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Lay your crochet piece out on the blocking mat or towel.</li>
      <li>Pin the piece in place, making sure to stretch it out to the desired shape and size.</li>
      <li>Spray the piece with water until it's damp.</li>
      <li>Let the piece dry completely.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Blocking can be especially helpful for lace patterns and for pieces that have curled or distorted during the crocheting process.</p>
